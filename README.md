## Todo's:
* Connect ML Kit base model - inside GameViewModel
* Select N images from the base model's supported images and start cropping, cluster to different categories
* Decide what else do we want to add: User profile, achievements?
* Add the basic flow of the app from the launch screen (currently skipping straight to GameFragment for debugging), RecyclerView for categories/levels?
* Create a unique theme for our app - colors, fonts, etc..
* Re-view Reem's explanation of uploading to Google Play. maybe do it once we have the basic game up and running so we won't miss the deadline?
* Read about working with files on android, where to store everything? 
    Maybe for now just have everything inside the app and later use Firebase
* Welcome/Greeting screen, displayed when first launching app / via help button. (low priority)
